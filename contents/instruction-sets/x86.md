#### *<p align='center'> Registers </p>*
---
* Temporary storage locations that are built into the CPU. Aside from the General Purpose Registers (GPRs), most other registers are dedicated to specific purposes
* The 6 16-bit selector registers for x86 architecture: CS, DS, ES, FS, GS, SS. A selector register contains address to a specific block of memory from which one can read or write. It was created to support accessing memory using the memory segmentation model, which most CPU today has already moved on from. Nowadays, memory addressing uses the flat memory model
  * Although memory segmentation is no longer relevant, FS or GS selector registers are sometimes still being used. For example, FS segment register points to the beginning of current Thread Environment Block (TEB), also know as Thread Information Block (TIB), on Windows. Offset zero in TEB is the head of a linked list of pointers to exception handler functions on 32-bit system. Offset 30h is the Process Environment Block (PEB) structure. In x64, PEB is located at offset 60h of the GS segment register
* Control register: EFLAGS. It contains arithmetic and system flag values 
  * Arithmetic flags are used by [JCC](https://c9x.me/x86/html/file_module_x86_id_146.html) instructions to decide whether to jump or not 
  * System flags are more specific. For example, Direction Flag (DF) is only used by string instructions (STOS, SCAS, LODS, MOVS, CMPS) to decide whether to process strings from high to low addresses or the other way around

#### *<p align='center'> Assembly to Machine Code Is Not One-To-One </p>*
---
* An opcode can have multiple mnemonics associated with it and a mnemonic can have multiple opcodes associated with it
* __Example 1__: 0x75 is both the opcode for JNZ and JNE
* __Example 2__: 0xb142 and 0xc6c142 both corresponds to the instruction MOV CL, 66

---
#### *<p align='center'> Lost Of Type Information </p>*
---
* There is no way to tell the datatype of something stored in memory by just looking at the location of where it is stored. Instead, the datatype is implied by the operations that are used on it
* If an instruction loads a value into EAX, comparison is taken place between EAX and 0x10, and JA is used to jump to another location if EAX is greater, then we know that the value is an unsigned int since JA is a jump instruction for unsigned numbers

---
#### *<p align='center'> Floating Point Arithmetic </p>*
---
* Floating point operations are performed using the FPU Register Stack, or the "x87 Stack." FPU is divided into 8 registers, st0 to st7. Typical FPU operations will pop item(s) off the stack, perform on it/them, and push the result back to the stack
* FLD instruction is for loading values onto the FPU Register Stack
* FST instruction is for storing values from ST0 into memory 
* FPU Register Stack can be accessed only by FPU instructions

---
#### *<p align='center'> Variable-Length Instruction </p>*
---
* An instruction's size in x86 can range from 1 to 15 bytes

#### *<p align='center'> Commonly Used But Hard To Remember x86 Instructions With Side Effects </p>*
---
* __Side Effects?__: effects on memory and registers after executing a particular instruction without the effects being explicitly stated in the instruction opcode or operand(s)
  * [Binary Ninja](https://binary.ninja/) does a good job revealing implicit registers usage

* __IMUL reg/mem__: register is multiplied with AL, AX, or EAX and the result is stored in AX, DX:AX, or EDX:EAX
* __IDIV reg/mem__: takes one parameter (divisor). Depending on the divisorâ€™s size, div will use either AX, DX:AX, or EDX:EAX as the dividend, and the resulting quotient/remainder pair are stored in AL/AH, AX/DX, or EAX/EDX
* __STOS(B/W/D)__: writes the value AL/AX/EAX to EDI. Commonly used to initialize a buffer to a constant value
* __SCAS(B/W/D)__: compares AL/AX/EAX with data starting at the memory address EDI
* __LODS(B/W/D)__: reads 1, 2, or 4 byte value from esi and stores it in al, ax, or eax 
* __MOVS(B/W/D)__: moves data with 1, 2, or 4 byte granularity between two memory addresses. They implicitly use EDI/ESI as the destination/source address
* __CLD/STD__: CLD/STD clears/sets direction flag (DF). If DF is 1, addresses are decremented. It is used by STOS(B/W/D), SCAS(B/W/D), LODS(B/W/D), and MOVS(B/W/D)  
* __REP__: repeats an instruction up to ECX times
* __PUSHAD/POPAD__: pushes/pops all 8 general-purpose registers 
* __PUSHFD/POPFD__: pushes/pops EFLAGS register 
* __MOVSX/MOVZX__: both works like a MOV except MOVSX sign-extends the value in the destination register while MOVZX zero-extends the value in the destination register   
* __CMOVcc__: if the condition code's (cc) corresponding flag is set in EFLAGS, MOV will be performed. Otherwises, it's just like a NOP
