---
#### *<p align='center'> Changing Default Settings </p>*
---
* To make changes permanent, write it in the .gdbinit file
* ASLR is turned off by default in GDB. To turn it on: __set disable-randomization off__
* Default displays assembly in AT&T notation. To display assembly in Intel notation: __set disassembly-flavor intel__ 

---
#### *<p align='center'> User Inputs </p>*
---
* How to pass user inputs to debugged program as arguments or/and as stdin:
  * After starting GDB...
      ```gdb
      (gdb) run argument1 argument2 < file
      ```
  * content of file will be passed to debugged program's stdin

---
#### *<p align='center'> Automation </p>*
---
* __-x Option__: puts the list of commands you want GDB to run when gdb starts in a file and run GDB with the -x option
    ```bash
    gdb -x command_file program_to_debug
    ```
* __Hooks__: user-defined command. When command ? is ran, user-defined command 'hook-?' will be executed (if it exists)
  * When reversing, it could be useful to hook on breakpoints by using hook-stop 
  * How to define a hook: 
     ```gdb
     (gdb) define hook-?
     > ...commands...
     > end
     (gdb)
     ```

---
#### *<p align='center'> Ways To Pause Debuggee </p>*
---
* __Software Breakpoint__:
  ```bash
  (gdb) break *0x8048479
  ```
  * __shortcut__: if the instruction pointer is at the address that you wanted to break at, simply type b or break and a breakpoint will be set there
* __Hardware Breakpoint__:
  ```bash
  (gdb) hbreak *0x8048479 
  ```
* __Watchpoint__:
  ```bash
  (gdb) watch *0x8048560  #break on write
  (gdb) rwatch *0x8048560 #break on read
  (gdb) awatch *0x8048560 #break on read/write
  ```
* __Catchpoint__:
  ```bash
  (gdb) catch syscall #break at every call/return from a system call
  ```

---
#### *<p align='center'> Useful Commands </p>*
---
* __apropos &lt;arg&gt;__ command searches through all gdb commands/documentations for &lt;arg&gt; and displays matched command/documentation pairs

* __i (info)__ command displays information on the item specified to the right of it
  * __i proc mappings__: shows mapped address spaces 
  * __i b__: shows all breakpoints 
  * __i r__: shows the values in general purpose, flag, and segment registers at that point of execution
  * __i all r__: shows the values in all registers at that point of execution, such as FPU and XMM registers  
* __x (examine)__ command displays memory contents at a given address in the specified format
  * Since disas command won't work on stripped binary, x command can come in handy to display instructions from current program counter: __x/14i $pc__
* __set__ command can be used to set temporary variable, change value in memory, or change value in register : __set $&lt;name&gt; = &lt;value&gt;__
  * From user code, one can't directly access the instruction pointer; instruction pointer can only be edited through JMP, CALL, or RET. It's a different story when the program is under GDB though. Instruction pointer can be easily changed using the set command: __set $eip = &lt;address&gt;__ 
  * It is useful to be able to change the a flag in FLAGS/EFLAGS/RFLAGS (status register) to see how taking the unintended branch for a [JCC](https://c9x.me/x86/html/file_module_x86_id_146.html) instruction will affect later program behavior. To update a flag, you just need to know the bit position of the flag you wanted to change 
    * To set the zero flag:
      ```bash
      (gdb) set $ZF = 6                #bit position 6 in EFLAGS is zero flag
      (gdb) set $eflags |= (1 << $ZF)  #use that variable to set the zero flag bit
      ```
