__Reversing Is Easy?__
* Aside from that a [compiler will bloat up the size of the compiled code](https://twitter.com/MalwareTechBlog/status/959925068196294656), reverse engineering for the purpose of understanding how a program works is really not a hard task. Even though [x86](https://github.com/yellowbyte/reverse-engineering-reference-manual/blob/master/contents/instruction-sets/x86.md) [instruction set](https://github.com/yellowbyte/reverse-engineering-reference-manual/blob/master/contents/instruction-sets/instruction-sets.md) is enormous and source to assembly is a one-to-many relationship, a compiler will usually prefer only a subset of the [x86](https://github.com/yellowbyte/reverse-engineering-reference-manual/blob/master/contents/instruction-sets/x86.md) [instruction set](https://github.com/yellowbyte/reverse-engineering-reference-manual/blob/master/contents/instruction-sets/instruction-sets.md) to translate the source code to. It might take longer to understand the disassembly, but after reversing for a while, you will start to notice the same assembly patterns and [idioms](https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/17540/tutorial-or-resource-for-understanding-obscure-assembly-idioms) over and over again. Getting used to those idioms and common assembly constructs for high-level languages (e.g. for loop, if statement, function call) help you decipher the purpose of a group of instructions quicker. Eventually, you will be able to understand on a high level what portion of the disassembly is doing what. Once you reach this state, the program is yours. 

__Not So Fast...__
* Obviously there are people that don't want their programs to be analyzed. When that is the case, they will use various techniques to hinder reversing of their software. The well-known anti-analysis techniques can be seen below but there are also many more undocumented or less-known ones. The good news is: no matter how hard one tried to obfuscate a program, there is no guarantee that it cannot be de-obfuscated. It is only a matter of time before a protected program is taken apart. Furthermore, unless the program is a crackme or a reversing challenge, one can't simply try to make the program as hard to reverse as possible since program performance also needs to be taken into consideration. Depending on the anti-analysis techniques and on what portion of the code is hardened, the performance difference could be fairly noticeably.
